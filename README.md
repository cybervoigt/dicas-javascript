Studying GIT + GITHUB + Javascript  :-)

I'm having some difficults on execute the command

git push origin master

I'm having this messages on the VSCode terminal:

error: src refspec master does not match any

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/cybervoigt/dicas-javascript.git'

(I don't know how, but now it's working :-)




## 2022-05-24 - List of commands, after edit loops.js:

- git add loops.js
- git commit -m "teste de commit 2022-05-24"
- git pull origin main
- git status
- git push



Now I'm editing readme.md with notepad++ and I'll run GIT with command line
